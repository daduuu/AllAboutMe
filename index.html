I have a strong passion for both computer science and math and I love how they go hand in hand in solving various problems. In my free time I like to cook and practice Chinese yoyo.</p>

                            <p class="f3">I'm a rising senior in the Academy for Technology and Computer Science at Bergen County Academies (BCA). Throughout my 3 years at my school, I’ve had the opportunity to take many challenging courses on computer science and great teachers to really improve my overall programming and logical thinking skills. This was not only the place that I fell in love with learning, but the place I’ve been lucky to make many friends, from doing clubs together like the Chinese Yoyo Club to just hanging out on the weekends BCA hasn’t only been just a school to me, it’s been a home.</p>

                            <p class="f3">I teach competitive mathematics to middle schoolers at my local Chinese school every Sunday during the school season. I first started here not knowing if I would like teaching, but I soon realised that I loved it. It made me realise how important teaching and mentoring actually are, and how much it helps others grow. From this, I learned to always explore new opportunities and venture into the unknown, as I wasn’t even sure I would like teaching, but came to love it, and how to efficiently communicate and design a detailed lesson plan for the entire year.</p>

                            <p class="f3">I helped high schoolers review the SAT math exam during the summer. I was happy to find a job that allowed me to teach to people my age, as so far I had only taught middle schoolers. During this job I had to think quickly in order to solve math problems so I could explain them and help my peers work through them and understand them. This opportunity taught me how to work with my peers, how to effectively communicate as a group, and how to make learning interesting.</p>
